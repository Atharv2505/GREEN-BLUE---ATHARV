        <p class="para-content">Saving water means not wasting water: only using the water than we need and keeping the rest of the water clean and unpolluted. When we save water, we do so both for our generation and for future generations. The importance of saving water. Use a toilet flush which consumes less water. Water your plants early in the morning or late in the evening to reduce water loss due to evaporation. While watering plants, use watering-can instead of a running hose. For watering plants, use waste water that comes off washing of food items. Meaning: “Save water, save life” means that if we use our water supplies wisely we will be able to preserve life on our planet. Life here can denote all life forms, from plants to animals to humans. Water is one of the most important constituent for all living organisms. Water conservation includes all the policies, strategies and activities to sustainably manage the natural resource of fresh water, to protect the hydrosphere, and to meet the current and future human demand. Population, household size and growth and affluence all affect how much water is used. Factors such as climate change have increased pressures on natural water resources especially in manufacturing and agricultural irrigation. Many countries have already implemented policies aimed at water conservation, with much success. The key activities to conserve water are as follows: any beneficial reduction in water loss, use and waste of resources, avoiding any damage to water quality; and improving water management practices that reduce the use or enhance the beneficial use of water.</p>

        3. Practice rainwater harvesting. RWAs should adopt this in every public park of their locality. Make sure you have a faucet aerator on each faucet. These inexpensive appliances conserve water, keeping water pressure high. Make roof top rain water harvesting and recharging wells/ tanks man

        4. Don’t overwater your lawn or water during peak periods, and install rain sensors on irrigation systems. <br> <br>
